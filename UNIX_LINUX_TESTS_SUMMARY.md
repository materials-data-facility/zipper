### Test Results

The test runner provides specific feedback for UNIX/Linux platform verification:

```
üêß UNIX/LINUX PLATFORM VERIFICATION:

    reason="UNIX/Linux specific tests not applicable on Windows"
)
```

## Recommendations for UNIX/Linux Production Use

### Pre-Deployment Testing

1. **Run platform-specific tests**:
   ```bash
   python run_tests.py --unix-linux --verbose
   ```

2. **Test on target filesystem**:
   - NFS, CIFS, or other network filesystems
   - Local filesystems (ext4, xfs, btrfs, etc.)
   - Special mount options (nodev, nosuid, etc.)

3. **Verify with actual data patterns**:
   - Test with representative file types
   - Include sparse files if relevant
   - Test with actual permission structures

### Production Configuration

1. **Signal Handling**:
   ```bash
   # Install signal handlers for clean shutdown
   trap 'echo "Received SIGTERM, shutting down gracefully"' TERM
   ```

2. **Resource Monitoring**:
   ```bash
   # Monitor file descriptor usage
   ulimit -n
   
   # Monitor CPU time limits
   ulimit -t
   ```

3. **Network Filesystem Considerations**:
   - Use appropriate timeout settings
   - Monitor for stale handle errors
   - Consider local staging for network filesystems
